# StudioGram Redesign – Agent Handoff

## Context
- Project: `instagram-story-schedule-generator`
- Environment: Vite + React + TypeScript with TailwindCSS (configured in `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `index.css`).
- Templates reference files live in `templates/` (HTML mockups + `studiogram-implementation-guide.md`). Keep these handy when matching UI.

## Completed Prompts
1. **Phase 1 – Design Tokens & Base Components**
   - Tailwind design tokens and utilities added; core UI primitives (`components/ui/*`).
2. **Phase 2 – Gym Finder redesign** (desktop + empty state).
3. **Phase 3 – Editor shell & preview**
   - New editor route (`pages/EditorPage.tsx`) with zoom/device controls, preview canvas.
4. **Phase 4 – Style tab**
   - Palette selector, background/logo uploads, Google Storage integration for uploads.
5. **Phase 5 – Content tab**
   - Element reorder + visibility panel.
   - Font settings modal with live preview updates.
   - Color picker modal with presets + custom hex input.
6. **Phase 6 – Layout tab** (Prompt 6.1)
   - Corner radius slider, spacing presets, layout style selector, divider options, accent/footer toggles wired into preview.
7. **Phase 7 – Save & Export**
   - Save button persists template state with loading/success feedback.
   - Export button captures preview canvas to PNG with download prompt.
8. **Phase 8 – Page Transitions** (Prompt 8.1)
   - `PageTransition` wrapper uses Framer Motion for fade/slide animations across all routes.
9. **Phase 8 – Micro-interactions** (Prompt 8.2)
   - Buttons, icon controls, and interactive cards gain subtle lift/scale hover states and focus polish per design guide.
10. **Phase 8 – Entrance Animations** (Prompt 8.3)
   - Added shared stagger hook with fade/slide-in motion across palette, content, and saved gym lists plus empty state highlights.
11. **Phase 9 – Gym Finder Responsive** (Prompt 9.1)
   - Mobile-first refinements for header, hero, cards, and saved gyms with larger touch targets and edge-to-edge search results.
12. **Phase 9 – Editor Mobile-Friendly** (Prompt 9.2)
   - Editor stacks preview and panels on mobile with bottom action bar, touch targets, and full-screen modals.

## Outstanding Work
- **Phase 10 Prompt 10.1 – Loading states polish**
- Continue remaining prompts in `templates/studiogram-implementation-guide.md` (10.1 → 10.2).

## Collaboration Rules
- When you complete a prompt, update this handoff file immediately after verifying the implementation in code. Do not mark prompts complete based on assumptions or external context.

## Usage Notes
- Preview styling reads from `elementStyles`, `spacing`, `layoutStyle`, etc. When adding new controls ensure they update `pages/EditorPage.tsx` state and pass through to `SchedulePreview`.
- For UI parity consult the HTML mockups:
  - `templates/studiogram-editor-desktop.html`
  - `templates/studiogram-editor-mockup.html`
  - `templates/studiogram-animation-timeline.html`
- Assets upload via Firebase Storage (`services/storage.ts`).
- Keep Tailwind classes (no CSS modules). Use UI primitives from `components/ui/` wherever possible.

## Branch & Git Notes
- Large diff currently staged; coordinate with existing work before committing.
- Templates directory is tracked—no special gitignore rules.
